# Real-Or-Fake-Photo-Face-Detection-Using-Eye-Blink-Detection
This is a small project that I worked on in Python
Install dlib
A file is required 'shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat' which can be downloaded from this link: 
https://github.com/italojs/facial-landmarks-recognition/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
Keep this file in the same folder as the main python code file
Further description of the code is given in the .py file as comments :) Happy Coding in Python.
